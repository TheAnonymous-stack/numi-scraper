Triangle R'S'T' is drawn in green with corresponding vertices at R'(2,7), S'(6,5), and T'(5,8). The triangles are congruent and have the same shape and size. Based on the positions of the points, triangle R'S'T' appears to be the result of a translation followed by a reflection. Specifically, triangle RST is translated 3 units right and 10 units up, then reflected across the y-axis to map onto triangle R'S'T'.",
