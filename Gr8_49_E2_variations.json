    "backend_description": "The image shows a triangular pyramid with a triangular base and three triangular faces. Each side of the base measures 5 cm. The height of the base triangle is labeled as 4.3 cm and is indicated by a vertical dashed line inside the base. Each of the three triangular faces shares a 5 cm side with the base and has a height of 9 cm from the base to the apex of the pyramid. Dashed lines are used to indicate the slant height of the faces, and arrows point to all the key measurements on the figure.",

        "The image shows the surface area calculation for a triangular pyramid. There are four triangles representing the pyramid’s faces. Three of the triangles are identical, each labeled with the area formula 1/2 × 5 × 9 = 22.5, showing that each of these three faces has an area of 22.5 square meters. The fourth triangle, which is smaller, is labeled with the expression 1/2 × 5 × 4.3 = 10.75, indicating that this triangle has an area of 10.75 square meters. These four triangle areas represent the total surface area of the triangular pyramid."
