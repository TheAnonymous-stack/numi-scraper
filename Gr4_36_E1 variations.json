    "backend_description": "This image shows a simple step-by-step progression diagram with three stages. Each step is represented by a row of blue circles arranged horizontally. Step 1 contains 7 blue circles, Step 2 contains 11 blue circles, and Step 3 contains 15 blue circles. The circles appear to be solid blue and evenly spaced. Below each group of circles is gray text indicating 'step 1', 'step 2', and 'step 3' respectively. The overall layout suggests a progression or sequence where the number of elements increases with each step."
