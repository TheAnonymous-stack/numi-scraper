        "The image shows a table with three columns labeled 'crafters (x)', 'Calculation of cost (y)', and 'Cost (y)'. The rows show that for 1 crafter, the calculation is 18(1) and the cost is 18; for 2 crafters, the calculation is 18(2) and the cost is 36; for 3 crafters, the calculation is 18(3) and the cost is 54. The final row generalizes the pattern with x crafters, showing the calculation as 18(x) and the resulting cost as 18x, written in bold. The table demonstrates that the cost is directly proportional to the number of crafters, with a rate of 18 dollars per crafter."
