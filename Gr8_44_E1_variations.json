        "The image shows six rays—AG, BG, CG, DG, EG, and FG—that all meet at a common point labeled G. Rays AG and DG form a straight horizontal line. Rays BG and EG form another straight line that slants upward to the left and downward to the right, while CG and FG form a third line that slants upward to the right and downward to the left. These intersecting lines create several angles around point G. The angle ∠AGC is formed between rays AG and CG. A green arc marks ∠AGC, and a blue arc marks the adjacent angle ∠FGA, which together form a straight line."
